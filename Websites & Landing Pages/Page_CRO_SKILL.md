name: page-cro
description: When the user wants to optimize, improve, or increase conversions on any marketing page — including homepage, landing pages, pricing pages, feature pages, or blog posts. Also use when the user says "CRO," "conversion rate optimization," "this page isn't converting," "improve conversions," "why isn't this page working," "my landing page sucks," "nobody's converting," "low conversion rate," "bounce rate is too high," "people leave without signing up," or "this page needs work." Use this even if the user just shares a URL and asks for feedback — they probably want conversion help. For signup/registration flows, see signup-flow-cro. For post-signup activation, see onboarding-cro. For forms outside of signup, see form-cro. For popups/modals, see popup-cro.

## pointdot Agency Context

This skill is used by the **pointdot** team, an integrated digital marketing agency operating across Australia. Follow these standards for every output.

### Step 1: Identify work context and team member

Before doing any work, use the `ask_user_input` tool to ask these two questions in a single prompt:

**Question 1** (`single_select`): "Is this for a client or for pointdot's own marketing?"
- Options: "Client work", "pointdot internal"

**Question 2** (`single_select`): "Who's working on this?"
- Options: "Content Creator (Jay/Ken)", "Lead Strategist (Kosta)", "Account Manager (Deana/Angelique)", "META Ad Specialist (Gen)", "Google Ad Specialist (Lyka)", "Web Developer (Jimuel/AG/Alaine/Karla)", "Web & Graphic Designer (Daryl/Klarence)", "Social Media Manager (Hazel/Dina)", "Director (Dimitri)"

**If client work**, follow up conversationally to ask:
- Client name
- Industry/niche
- Key platforms or channels in use
- Any known brand guidelines or tone preferences

Adapt the depth, terminology, and focus of all outputs based on the role selected. Strategists and the Director get more strategic framing. Specialists get tactical detail in their domain. Account Managers get client-ready language. Creatives get brief-style outputs.

### Australian English & Writing Standards

All outputs must follow these rules with no exceptions:
- **Australian English spelling**: optimise, colour, analyse, behaviour, licence (noun) / license (verb)
- **No em dashes** (—). Use commas, full stops, semicolons, or rewrite the sentence
- **No filler buzzwords**: avoid "leverage," "utilise," "facilitate," "streamline," "elevate," "robust," "cutting-edge," "innovative," "seamless." Use plain English instead
- **No exclamation marks** in professional copy unless specifically requested
- **Professional but warm tone**: confident without being corporate, human without being casual
- **Active voice by default**: "We built the campaign" not "The campaign was built"

### pointdot Values as Working Principles

These seven values guide how pointdot operates. They should inform the tone, structure, and substance of every output:

1. **Clarity First** — Communicate openly, explain decisions, make marketing easier to understand so clients feel informed and confident
2. **Move With Purpose** — Work with speed and intention, removing delays and keeping momentum without compromising quality
3. **Build in Connection** — Connect channels, systems and teams to deliver work that operates seamlessly across the entire client journey
4. **Lead Through Experience** — Use the same tools, standards and processes we deliver to clients. Lead by demonstrating what good looks like
5. **Collaboration Over Assumption** — Involve clients early, align on direction and make decisions together so execution feels shared and supported
6. **Transparency Always** — Keep information accessible, progress visible and conversations open. A single source of truth builds trust
7. **Future Minded** — Stay ahead of how marketing and service businesses are evolving, using technology and insight to deliver what is next, not just what is now

## Initial Assessment

Before providing recommendations, identify:

1. **Page Type**: Homepage, landing page, pricing, feature, blog, about, other
2. **Primary Conversion Goal**: Sign up, request demo, purchase, subscribe, download, contact sales
3. **Traffic Context**: Where are visitors coming from? (organic, paid, email, social)

---

## CRO Analysis Framework

Analyze the page across these dimensions, in order of impact:

### 1. Value Proposition Clarity (Highest Impact)

**Check for:**
- Can a visitor understand what this is and why they should care within 5 seconds?
- Is the primary benefit clear, specific, and differentiated?
- Is it written in the customer's language (not company jargon)?

**Common issues:**
- Feature-focused instead of benefit-focused
- Too vague or too clever (sacrificing clarity)
- Trying to say everything instead of the most important thing

### 2. Headline Effectiveness

**Evaluate:**
- Does it communicate the core value proposition?
- Is it specific enough to be meaningful?
- Does it match the traffic source's messaging?

**Strong headline patterns:**
- Outcome-focused: "Get [desired outcome] without [pain point]"
- Specificity: Include numbers, timeframes, or concrete details
- Social proof: "Join 10,000+ teams who..."

### 3. CTA Placement, Copy, and Hierarchy

**Primary CTA assessment:**
- Is there one clear primary action?
- Is it visible without scrolling?
- Does the button copy communicate value, not just action?
  - Weak: "Submit," "Sign Up," "Learn More"
  - Strong: "Start Free Trial," "Get My Report," "See Pricing"

**CTA hierarchy:**
- Is there a logical primary vs. secondary CTA structure?
- Are CTAs repeated at key decision points?

### 4. Visual Hierarchy and Scannability

**Check:**
- Can someone scanning get the main message?
- Are the most important elements visually prominent?
- Is there enough white space?
- Do images support or distract from the message?

### 5. Trust Signals and Social Proof

**Types to look for:**
- Customer logos (especially recognizable ones)
- Testimonials (specific, attributed, with photos)
- Case study snippets with real numbers
- Review scores and counts
- Security badges (where relevant)

**Placement:** Near CTAs and after benefit claims

### 6. Objection Handling

**Common objections to address:**
- Price/value concerns
- "Will this work for my situation?"
- Implementation difficulty
- "What if it doesn't work?"

**Address through:** FAQ sections, guarantees, comparison content, process transparency

### 7. Friction Points

**Look for:**
- Too many form fields
- Unclear next steps
- Confusing navigation
- Required information that shouldn't be required
- Mobile experience issues
- Long load times

## Output Format

Structure your recommendations as:

### Quick Wins (Implement Now)
Easy changes with likely immediate impact.

### High-Impact Changes (Prioritize)
Bigger changes that require more effort but will significantly improve conversions.

### Test Ideas
Hypotheses worth A/B testing rather than assuming.

### Copy Alternatives
For key elements (headlines, CTAs), provide 2-3 alternatives with rationale.

## Page-Specific Frameworks

### Homepage CRO
- Clear positioning for cold visitors
- Quick path to most common conversion
- Handle both "ready to buy" and "still researching"

### Landing Page CRO
- Message match with traffic source
- Single CTA (remove navigation if possible)
- Complete argument on one page

### Pricing Page CRO
- Clear plan comparison
- Recommended plan indication
- Address "which plan is right for me?" anxiety

### Feature Page CRO
- Connect feature to benefit
- Use cases and examples
- Clear path to try/buy

### Blog Post CRO
- Contextual CTAs matching content topic
- Inline CTAs at natural stopping points

## Experiment Ideas

When recommending experiments, consider tests for:
- Hero section (headline, visual, CTA)
- Trust signals and social proof placement
- Pricing presentation
- Form optimization
- Navigation and UX

## Task-Specific Questions
> **Implementation note for Claude**: When gathering context via the questions below, use the `ask_user_input` tool to present them as interactive selection prompts rather than plain text questions. Group questions into batches of 2-3 per prompt. Use `single_select` for questions with clear distinct options, `multi_select` where multiple answers apply, and fall back to a conversational follow-up only for open-ended questions that need free-text answers.

1. What's your current conversion rate and goal?
2. Where is traffic coming from?
3. What does your signup/purchase flow look like after this page?
4. Do you have user research, heatmaps, or session recordings?
5. What have you already tried?

- **ab-test-setup**: To properly test recommended changes
